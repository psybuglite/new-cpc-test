    The unit coordinates procurement activities of the Council. It is the implementing internal organ of the Public Procurement Act (PPA), 2007 and Procurement Procedure Manual. The unit is the Council’s interface with the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) and its third-party contractors, vendors and service providers. The unit works closely with the technical personnel of the procuring entity who have expertise on the subject matter, the Procurement Planning Committee and the Parastatal Tenders Board. It ensures compliance with due process relating to planning and approvals within the Council's threshold. 
    
    The Procurement Unit advertises, solicits for bids with guidelines, issued by the BPP from time to time. It also receives, examines and maintains appropriate documentation for bids received. The unit obtains a certificate of ‘No Objection’ for contract awards from BPP and makes submissions to the Council’s Tenders Board. It is also the responsibility of the unit to debrief the bid loser on request, resolve complaints or dispute (if any), obtain guarantees and confirm the validity of job performance.
