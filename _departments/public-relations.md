title: Public Relations (PR) Unit

    The unit is the vital conduit between the Council and the public. Operating from the Office of the Director General, the unit is responsible for the entire communications value chain of the Council, both internal and external. As the image manager of the Council, the PR Unit coordinates strategic communication, engages in crisis and perception management where necessary and manages the Council’s presence on multiple platforms.

    The sensitive role and balance the unit plays are best underscored by the operations of other departments, such as Surveillance &amp; Enforcement, Consumer Education and Quality, Assurance and Development, which use the various communication channels and platforms to discharge their responsibilities.

    In addition, maintaining and expanding the Council’s relationship with both conventional and new media in a fast moving and dynamic environment, covering multiple sectors and gathering information about developments for timely releases or intervention are some of the daily round the clock responsibilities of the Public Relations Unit.
