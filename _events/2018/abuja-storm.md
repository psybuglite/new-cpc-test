Following the usual routine inspection and laboratory tests of quality of products in the markets by the Council’s Quality Assurance and Development Officers, it was discovered that some products were grossly under weight. This led to further inspection of the premises of the default producers.

One of such producers is Agel Global Resources, makers of Agel Corn flour in Piwoyi, along Airport Road, Abuja. The Council had earlier discovered on weighing that the actual net weight of Agel Corn flour product was between 180 to 250g while the weight declared on the product label was 450g.

The inspection of Agel premises further revealed many other products were packed in the same manner to deceive consumers. Other gross non conformities to Good Hygienic and Manufacturing Practices were discovered. This led to the mobilisation of Council’s Surveillance and

Enforcement Officers without delay, to remove all the non-conforming products with respect to weight from the premises. It was also discovered that the products were produced in an unhygienic environment.
