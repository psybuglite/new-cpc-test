    CPC is established by law to protect citizens in the market place. Essentially, our role is to prevent abuse, exploitation and any form of mistreatment or disregard with respect to consumers. Where something has gone wrong and a consumer(s) is/are aggrieved, we exercise the tools provided by laws and regulations to ensure remedies for consumers.

    A critical mandate of the Council includes collaboration with industry, trade and professional associations and other relevant stakeholders, particularly civil society. The reason and purpose for this collaboration is that; in addition to being an effective mechanism for educating consumers about their rights, it also provides vital channels for periodic and relevant information about emerging issues consumers need to be aware of. As such, and in furtherance of this partnership, the Council maintains a register of Non-profit Consumer Protection Associations (CPAs) that are recognized for their consumer protection work.

    We are happy that youâ€™re interested in partnering with us and welcome the opportunity to jointly and mutually engage for the protection of consumers. This Guide is useful in assisting prospective CPC registered CPAs with the registration process.
